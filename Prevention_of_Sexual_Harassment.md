# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH)

## Question 1: What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Based on the PoSH document and training videos, sexual harassment can include:

- **Unwanted physical contact** such as touching, patting, or brushing against someone.  
- **Inappropriate comments** on body, clothes, or personal life.  
- **Sexual jokes, gestures, or remarks** that make someone uncomfortable.  
- **Displaying or sharing offensive material** like pictures, messages, or videos.  
- **Unwelcome advances** such as repeated requests for dates or personal meetings.  
- **Quid pro quo behaviour** – asking for sexual favours in exchange for work benefits.  
- **Creating a hostile work environment** by constant teasing, bullying, or intimidation related to gender.

## Question 2: What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

- **Stay calm and safe** – move away from the situation if needed.  
- **Say "No" clearly** and let the person know their behaviour is not acceptable.  
- **Document the incident** – note the date, time, place, and people involved.  
- **Report the case** to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or HR as per the PoSH policy.  
- **Support the victim** if you are a witness – listen to them, encourage them to report, and share what you saw.  
- **Follow the company’s official process** – do not ignore, hide, or try to settle it informally.  
- **Promote respectful workplace behaviour** – treat colleagues with dignity and ensure a safe environment for all.
