## Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- Always over-communicate small issues like no internet, laptop not working, or requirement changes.  
- Join meetings 5â€“10 minutes early to build better connection with the team.  
- Use tools like Codepen, Codesandbox, or Github gists to share code and problems.  
- Block social media sites and apps during work hours using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom.  
- Track time with apps like Boosted to improve productivity.

## Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

**Area to improve:** Communication with team members.  

**Ideas to improve:**  
- Write down all my questions and send them in one clear message instead of many small ones.  
- Inform the team quickly if I face a problem or delay in work.  
- Keep my video on in meetings to build better rapport.  
- Be available to reply fast when someone helps me.  
- Join meetings a little early to talk casually with the team.
